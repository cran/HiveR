How to install HiveR
===================

To install from Github using R:
------------------------------
install.packages("devtools")

library("devtools")

install_github(repo = "HiveR", username = "bryanhanson", branch = "master")

library("HiveR")

vignette("HiveR") # To see the user guide

If you use branch = "devel" you can get the development branch if it is available.  devel versions would be ahead of what's on CRAN.  devel versions may be buggy in certain functions/actions.

From CRAN using R:
------------------

chooseCRANmirror() # select a CRAN mirror

install.packages("HiveR")

library("HiveR")

vignette("HiveR") # to see the user guide
