How to install HiveR
===================

To install from Github using R:
------------------------------
install.packages("devtools")

library("devtools")

install_github(repo = "HiveR", username = "bryanhanson", branch = "master")

library("HiveR")

vignette("HiveR") # To see the user guide

If you use branch = "devel" you can get the development branch if it is available.  My habit is to keep these operational but not necessarily complete.  Devel versions would be ahead of what's on CRAN.

From CRAN using R:
------------------
install.packages("HiveR")

library("HiveR")

vignette("HiveR") # to see the user guide
