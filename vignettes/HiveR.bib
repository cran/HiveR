Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has a small genome and therefore
   relies heavily on the host cellular machinery to replicate. Identifying
   which host proteins and complexes come into physical contact with the
   viral proteins is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how HIV
   rewires the host's cellular machinery during the course of infection.
   Here we report the use of affinity tagging and purification mass
   spectrometry(1-3) to determine systematically the physical interactions
   of all 18 HIV-1 proteins and polyproteins with host proteins in two
   different human cell lines (HEK293 and Jurkat). Using a quantitative
   scoring system that we call MiST, we identified with high confidence 497
   HIV-human protein-protein interactions involving 435 individual human
   proteins, with similar to 40\% of the interactions being identified in
   both cell types. We found that the host proteins hijacked by HIV,
   especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly
   conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes
   targeted by viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease
   cleaves eIF3d, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3.
   This host protein is one of eleven identified in this analysis that act
   to inhibit HIV replication. This data set facilitates a more
   comprehensive and detailed understanding of how the host machinery is
   manipulated during the course of HIV infection.}},

doi = {10.1093/bib/bbr069}, 
abstract ={Networks are typically visualized with force-based or spectral layouts. These algorithms lack reproducibility and perceptual uniformity because they do not use a node coordinate system. The layouts can be difficult to interpret and are unsuitable for assessing differences in networks. To address these issues, we introduce hive plots (http://www.hiveplot.com) for generating informative, quantitative and comparable network layouts. Hive plots depict network structure transparently, are simple to understand and can be easily tuned to identify patterns of interest. The method is computationally straightforward, scales well and is amenable to a plugin for existing tools.},

Abstract = {{RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) is the primary reference
   database of the best-known regulatory network of any free-living
   organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. The major conceptual change
   since 3 years ago is an expanded biological context so that
   transcriptional regulation is now part of a unit that initiates with the
   signal and continues with the signal transduction to the core of
   regulation, modifying expression of the affected target genes
   responsible for the response. We call these genetic sensory response
   units, or Gensor Units. We have initiated their high-level curation,
   with graphic maps and superreactions with links to other databases.
   Additional connectivity uses expandable submaps. RegulonDB has summaries
   for every transcription factor (TF) and TF-binding sites with internal
   symmetry. Several DNA-binding motifs and their sizes have been redefined
   and relocated. In addition to data from the literature, we have
   incorporated our own information on transcription start sites (TSSs) and
   transcriptional units (TUs), obtained by using high-throughput
   whole-genome sequencing technologies. A new portable drawing tool for
   genomic features is also now available, as well as new ways to download
   the data, including web services, files for several relational database
   manager systems and text files including BioPAX format.}},

Title = {{Comparing genomes to computer operating systems in terms of the topology

Abstract = {{The genome has often been called the operating system (OS) for a living
   organism. A computer OS is described by a regulatory control network
   termed the call graph, which is analogous to the transcriptional
   regulatory network in a cell. To apply our firsthand knowledge of the
   architecture of software systems to understand cellular design
   principles, we present a comparison between the transcriptional
   regulatory network of a well-studied bacterium (Escherichia coli) and
   the call graph of a canonical OS (Linux) in terms of topology and
   evolution. We show that both networks have a fundamentally hierarchical
   layout, but there is a key difference: The transcriptional regulatory
   network possesses a few global regulators at the top and many targets at
   the bottom; conversely, the call graph has many regulators controlling a
   small set of generic functions. This top-heavy organization leads to
   highly overlapping functional modules in the call graph, in contrast to
   the relatively independent modules in the regulatory network. We further
   develop a way to measure evolutionary rates comparably between the two
   networks and explain this difference in terms of network evolution. The
   process of biological evolution via random mutation and subsequent
   selection tightly constrains the evolution of regulatory network hubs.
   The call graph, however, exhibits rapid evolution of its highly
   connected generic components, made possible by designers' continual
   fine-tuning. These findings stem from the design principles of the two
   systems: robustness for biological systems and cost effectiveness
   (reuse) for software systems.}},
