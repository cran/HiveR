HiveR is an R package for creating and plotting 2D and 3D hive plots. Hive plots are a unique method of displaying networks of all types in which node properties are mapped to axes rather than being arbitrarily positioned.  The hive plot concept was invented by Martin Krzywinski at the Genome Science Center (www.hiveplot.com).  See:

###### Version: 0.1-4
Date: 17 November 2011
News:
>> Some small changes to pass CRAN checks

###### Version: 0.1-3
Date: 14 November 2011
News:
>> Added nx = 4-6 for plotHive (2D mode).  Also added checking for empty sets of edges to plot, which gives an error when grid.curve is called.
>> Updated and expanded vignette.
>> Added function dot2HPD which processes graphs in .dot format into HPD objects, using auxiliary files which contain processing information.  Only supports some aspects of the .dot standard, but additional features are relatively easy to add.
>> Added function mineHPD which will read an HPD and extract further information from it.  The result is an updated HPD.  This function is intended to be easily extensible.
>> Numerous small improvements to the underlying code and the plot appearance.
>> Added the E. coli data set to the extdata folder.

###### Version: 0.1-2
Date: 9 November 2011
News:
>> This version is not going to CRAN.
>> Internal changes primarily.
>> Expanded vignette.
>> Added argument "type" to ranHiveData so that plots with 4-6 axes can be randomly generated in a 2D mode.  This seems to work but is not fully tested.  Next step is to make plotHive handle 4-6 axes.
>> In class HivePlotData, changed "dim" to axes, and added a descriptor "type" which indicates if the hive data is 2D or 3D.
